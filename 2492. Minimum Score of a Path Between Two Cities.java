// Medium

// Hint
// You are given a positive integer n representing n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are also given a 2D array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi, distancei] indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities ai and bi with a distance equal to distancei. The cities graph is not necessarily connected.

// The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance of a road in this path.

// Return the minimum possible score of a path between cities 1 and n.

// Note:

// A path is a sequence of roads between two cities.
// It is allowed for a path to contain the same road multiple times, and you can visit cities 1 and n multiple times along the path.
// The test cases are generated such that there is at least one path between 1 and n.
 

// Example 1:


// Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,9],[2,3,6],[2,4,5],[1,4,7]]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 4. The score of this path is min(9,5) = 5.
// It can be shown that no other path has less score.
// Example 2:


// Input: n = 4, roads = [[1,2,2],[1,3,4],[3,4,7]]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: The path from city 1 to 4 with the minimum score is: 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4. The score of this path is min(2,2,4,7) = 2.
 

// Constraints:

// 2 <= n <= 105
// 1 <= roads.length <= 105
// roads[i].length == 3
// 1 <= ai, bi <= n
// ai != bi
// 1 <= distancei <= 104
// There are no repeated edges.
// There is at least one path between 1 and n.
